Minimal Docker image with Java and the AWS CLI
----------------------------------------------

Basic [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to run [Java 8](https://www.java.com/) applications. This is based off [ubuntu-debootstrap](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu-debootstrap/) to keep the size minimal. Although, the use of the AWSCLI greatly increases the size of the image.
